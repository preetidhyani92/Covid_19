Description

🦠 COVID-19 Big Data Analysis using PySpark

This project demonstrates how PySpark can be used to handle and analyze large-scale datasets efficiently.
By using real-world COVID-19 data, we explore global trends, identify top affected countries, and visualize the spread of the pandemic.

📊 Project Overview

Goal: Perform big data analysis on COVID-19 dataset using PySpark

Tools Used:

Apache Spark (PySpark)

Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)

Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

Dataset:

covid_19.csv – Global COVID-19 dataset

top10_countries_confirmed.csv – Extracted summary of top 10 affected countries

⚙️ Key Features

Clean and preprocess large-scale COVID-19 data using PySpark

Perform distributed data processing to compute confirmed, recovered, and death counts

Visualize global trends and top 10 affected countries

Demonstrate scalability of PySpark for handling massive datasets

📈 Results

Countries with the highest confirmed cases identified

Trend analysis across continents and time

Insights into how data can be efficiently processed in distributed environments
